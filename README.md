This package allows you to attach a middleware for password confirmation to your routes. 
If user time is expired, the user will be redirected to a password confirmation page.

This feature protects your routes if you have a long session time.

**Note:** Exdends via `Illuminate\Auth\Middleware\RequirePassword` middleware.
